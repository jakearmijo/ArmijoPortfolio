            [Hello, World, !] My name is Jake Armijo. I am embedded with a love
            to create things. As a kid, I had Legos and Erector sets. As an
            adult, I received a degree in Applied Engineering and went into the
            construction field. I have been a PM and cost estimator working for
            the last 5 years. What I enjoy about construction is collaborating
            with teams, working on a wide variety of projects, battling critical
            timelines, and successfully completing goals. I enjoyed what I was
            doing in the construction industry and it was exciting to see your
            hard work go from plan to product, what I found was missing was that
            innovation wasnâ€™t there. It always interested me to see how I could
            use tech to do my job better. I researched coding, and coding boot
            camps, leveraged a lot of free resources and I landed on joining
            FullStack Academy. Now it has been a challenging ride filled with
            peaks and valleys, but hard work always pays off! I am looking to
            join an innovative company where I can leverage my past experiences
            in project management and teamwork combined with my bootcamp
            education to create new exciting things and make old ones better.
